ReDBox DLC is the next step forward for ReDBox. With the help of supporters like Research Data Services (RDS) and the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), QCIF is creating the ReDBox DLC service to support the Research Data Life Cycle Framework (DLCF). The DLCF is an Australian initiative designed to assist researchers in connecting their research activities with their research data as well as the eResearch infrastructure and services used to store, manage and process the data. ReDBox 2.0, slated for release mid 2018, will support the DLCF by assisting users to provision and manage storage infrastructure, then allowing users to extract manifests of data back into ReDBox and publishing the data files alongside the data collection metadata. In a major step towards supporting the DLC, QCIF has collaborated with RDS to create a portal available to all researchers to register their research activities.

<h3><a id="tool_Samvera">Samvera</a> (<a href="https://samvera.org/">samvera.org</a>)</h3>
<h4>Priority: none (framework)</h4><p>
Samvera software was conceived as an open source repository framework.  That is to say that we set out to create a series of free-to-use software “building blocks” that could put together in various combinations to achieve the repository system that an institution needed – as opposed to building a “one size fits all” solution. The framework as it exists today consists of a number of Ruby gems that can be combined, configured and adapted to serve a wide variety of needs, as you can see on our “applications and demos” page.  Some of our adopters started with just the basic building blocks, but then a more common approach became to find another institution whose use case was similar, clone their Samvera variant and then adapt it to more closely fit local needs.  Hyrax is the Community-developed Ruby gem that allows users to design and build their own, customized installation of our software. Using the Samvera framework in this way potentially allows an institution to build for themselves a repository solution closely fitted to their needs, however the building process and later the maintenance of such a customized system can be resource intensive.  In the last few years the Samvera Community has seen an emerging need for some off-the-shelf “solution bundles”, addressing particular needs, that can be installed and maintained with fewer local resources – or that can be deployed as a hosted, cloud service. <em>This description summarised from samvera.org.</em></p>
