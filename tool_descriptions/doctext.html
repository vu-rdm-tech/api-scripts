<h3><a href="https://www.fairdomhub.org/">FAIRDOMHub</a> (domain specific)</h3>
<p>
FAIRDOM is an initiative to develop a community, and establish an internationally sustained Data and Model Management service to the European Systems Biology community. FAIRDOM is a joint action of ERA-Net EraSysAPP and European Research Infrastructure ISBE.<br/>SEEK is a web-based cataloguing and commons platform, for sharing heterogeneous scientific research datasets, models or simulations, processes and research outcomes. It preserves associations between them, along with information about the people and organisations.<br/>Underpinning SEEK is the ISA infrastructure, a standard framework for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. Within SEEK, ISA has been extended and is configurable to allow the structure to be used outside of Biology.<br/>Flexible and detailed sharing permissions are available to manage the catalogued items from early collaborations within projects, through to the publishing of final research results. At this point a DOI can be generated for individual items, or entire aggregates packaged as Research Objects.
