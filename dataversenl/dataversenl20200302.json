        "description": "The Mediterranean region faces significant challenges to supply its growing population with food and living space. The regionâs potential to do so in the future is even more uncertain in the light of global change effects, particularly climate and socio-economic change. Until know, it was unknown how land use and land management can respond to such global challenges. We present a set of scenarios on potential future changes to Mediterranean land systems. First, we present two different pathways in fulfilling the growing demand for crops, livestock and urban space. One is oriented towards growth, without any restrictions in terms of limiting the withdrawal of water for irrigation or expansion of protected areas. The second presents a future, where consumption of water for irrigation is reduced, and the network of protected areas is significantly expanded. The second set of scenarios presents how land use and land management might respond to different levels of reduced water losses in the irrigation systems. Irrigated cropland in the region is characterized by different levels of efficiency. In the study we show, that significant reductions of water losses is necessary in order to increase crop production in the region. The maps present the spatial distribution of Mediterranean land systems today and in the future (2050), and can be imported in a GIS. The maps are created in a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection with a resolution of 2 x 2 km (custom projection with more details in the file \"readme_projection\"). We used the CLUMondo spatial allocation model in both studies. We present a novel approach, where we limit cropland intensification based on accessible water resources. Moreover, we studied what would decreases in water resources due to climate change mean to land use and land management. More information on the model in the publications and on www.environmentalgeography.nl The resulting scenarios can be used numerous ways: Evaluating different strategies to improve cropland productivity and increase crop production (implementing irrigation, improving irrigation efficiency, cropland intensification, crop type specialization, changes to multifunctionalityâ¦) Studying changes to Mediterranean terrestrial biodiversity and landscapes Identifying areas with different priorities: crop production, livestock grazing, biodiversity protectionâ¦",

They provide services to a large and growing population in a region that is among the most vulnerable to future global change. The spatial extent and distribution of Mediterranean land systems was, until now, unknown. We present a new, expert-based classification of Mediterranean land systems, representing landscapes as integrated social-ecological systems. We combined data on land cover, management intensity and livestock available on the European and global scale in a geographic information system based approach. We put special emphasis on agro-silvo-pastoral mosaic systems: multifunctional Mediterranean landscapes hosting different human activities that are not represented in common land cover maps.The resulting land systems typology can be used to prioritize and protect landscapes of high cultural and environmental significance. The map 'medi_LS' presents the spatial distribution of Mediterranean land system, and can be imported in a GIS. The map is created in a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection with a resolution of 2 x 2 km (custom projection with more details in the file \"readme_projection\").",

        "description": "Conservation agriculture (CA) is widely promoted as a sustainable agricultural management strategy and proposed to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation through reduced emission of greenhouse gases, increased solar radiation reflection, and the sustainable use of soil and water resources. To improve understanding of how CA management influences the land and climate system, we have developed the first global and spatially explicit data set of present-day CA distribution. National-level estimates of CA have been downscaled to a 5 arcminute regular grid based on multi-criteria analysis. We provide a best estimate of CA distribution and an uncertainty range in the form of a low and high estimate of CA distribution, reflecting the inconsistency in CA definitions. The present-day estimates are complemented by two scenarios of the potential future development of CA, combining present-day data and an assessment of the potential for implementation using biophysical and socioeconomic factors. By our estimates, 122 to 215 Mha or 9 to 15% of global arable land is currently managed under CA systems. Our scenario analysis suggests a future potential of CA in the range of 533 to 1130 Mha (38 to 81% of global arable land).",

Using a previous model configuration, specific adjustments were made according to SSP narratives. The projected demand for crop production, bovines, goats and sheep and urban area were provided by IMAGE, as were the exogenous productivity increase factors due to technological change, per year. For SSP1 demands were included for tons of crop production, head of bovines, goats and sheep (corrected to a âlivestock unitâ), builtup area and tons of carbon. The carbon demand was based on a no net loss situation where the total carbon content of all land systems was not allowed to fall below 2000 levels. For SSP2 and SSP3 demands were included for tons of crop production, head of bovines, goats and sheep (corrected to a âlivestock unitâ) and builtup area. Climate change was taken into account by incorporating change in the precipitation and temperature drivers and in cropland suitability conversion restrictions. Climate-induced changes in crop productivity were added to the exogenous productivity increase factors obtained from IMAGE. Climate change in both SSP1, SSP2 and SSP3 is projected to be about 6W/m2 by 2100. In 2050 this is equivalent to the RCP 4.5 and RCP 6 scenarios, or the SRES B1 scenario. Data used to determine the influence of climate change in CLUMondo was obtained from the Worldclim database and the FAOâs database on Global Agro-ecological zones.",

Understanding open space dynamics in relation to urban development is critical to the development and evaluation of such policies. Starting from a conceptual model that hypotheses how open space will have developed over the past century we use a set of landscape ecology based indicators to capture these changes from a societal (perceptional) perspective. The indicators are applied to a newly compiled geodatabase of urban development in the Netherlands to show their performance in detecting and understanding past and future trends in open space provision. The relevant spatial data files are provided here as a geodatabase in ESRI's .gdb format and as separate shapefiles (both as a zipped package including all files and as separate zipfiles for individual shapefiles). The shapefiles can be used in many GIS packages. The .mxd files can be used to add symbology to the data in various versions of ESRI's ArcGIS. The data uses the Dutch Rijksdriehoekstelsel_New (RD_New) projection system. The creation of the datasets and their origin is described in the related paper by Wagtendonk and Koomen (2019).",

        "description": "Theory of mind (ToM) processing is crucial in everyday social functioning. Fictional film narratives can elicit ToM, however, little is known about the cinematographic techniques underlying this effect. The present experiment focuses on the role of close-up shots of the characterâs face in viewersâ ToM responding, as well as in their cognitive and affective processing more generally. The online experiment (N = 495) included thirteen versions of an animated film and employed a 6 (Close-up frequency, 1 vs. 2. vs. 3 vs. 4 vs. 5 vs. 10) Ã 2 (Facial expression, neutral vs. sad) plus a control condition with zero close-up factorial between-subject design. Participants were randomly assigned to one version of the film and subsequently asked (with and without a prompt for ToM) to recall the story. In these free responses, the study used a quantitative content analytic method (with independent blind-coders) to identify the level of spontaneous and prompted ToM, as well as cognitive and affective processing employed by viewers. Additionally, we tested the moderation effect of character facial expression (in the close-up) and participant gender. Confirming our main hypothesis, close-up frequency significantly influenced ToM-spontaneous, but not ToM-prompted. Results indicate that increasing the number of close-ups may elicit higher levels of ToM-spontaneous up to a certain point, beyond which it may decrease spontaneous ToM responses. Results suggest that the effect of close-up frequency is specific to ToM processing rather than some general effect on cognitive and affective processing of narratives.",

        "description": "This dataset includes one file per hazard considered: tropical cyclones and earthquakes. Every file contains as first entries the name of the administrative level 2 exposed to the hazard. In the few cases where administrative level area 2 did not exist, we referred to the administrative level area 1. Each entry then contains the date at which the event occurred along with the ID of the event, as reported in the original datasets mentioned below. The date of the event is stored as a string with the following format: âyear-month-dayâ. For earthquakes, we considered areas subjected to a Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) category VIII or higher using a circular radius dependent on the earthquake moment magnitude recorded by the USGS Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog (U.S. Geological Survey 2017). This relationship was derived based on the analysis of 6,320 raster files (USGS ShakeMap) produced by USGS for earthquakes with a moment magnitude of at least 5. Based on this analysis, we find the following: ln A = 2.106 M - 8.160 where A is the area subject to an MMI of category VIII or higher and M is the moment magnitude of the earthquake. We use equation 1 to create a buffer area around the epicenter for all reported earthquakes by the USGS with a moment magnitude higher than 5. We intersect this area with all administrative level 2 areas exposed to an earthquake intensity of category VIII or higher. The event ID refers to the event name as stored by the USGS. For the areas affected by tropical cyclones, we generated footprints of tropical cyclones when these were either classed as tropical storms or higher intensity by applying a buffer of 80 km both sides from the track, following the method in Tate et al. (2010). We used the IBTrACS dataset v03r10 (Knapp et al. 2010) to indicate the position of the center of the tropical cyclone. The event ID refers to the event name as stored in the IBTrACS dataset.

        "description": "Open-space preservation is a planner's issue that is constantly debated, in particular on the success of the implemented instruments. We analysed the contribution of Dutch policies to open-space preservation by comparing actual land-use developments within different restrictive planning regimes. The Green Heart is the central open space within the ring of cities in the western part of the country. Protection of this area aimed at providing residents from the surrounding cities with opportunities for outdoor recreation at a short distance. The Buffer zones were designated in areas with a considerable urbanisation pressure and were intended to prevent specific cities from growing together into a solid urbanised belt, thus keeping separate cities recognisable as such in the landscape. In total, 10 Buffer zones have been designated, in size ranging from very small (3 hectares) to considerable (8700 hectares). Two relatively small zones are found in the heavily urbanised area near the city of Maastricht in the southern tip of the country. The others, in total claiming just over 20,000 hectares, are situated in the Randstad. The impact of these zones on urban development was first analysed in the related paper by Koomen, Dekkers and van Dijk (2008). In a subsequent paper we followed up on this analysis with other and more recent land-use data study the impact of changes in spatial planning and test the robustness of the results (Koomen and Dekkers, 2013). The relevant spatial data files are provided here as separate shapefiles that can be used in many GIS packages. The data uses the Dutch Rijksdriehoekstelsel_New (RD_New) projection system.",
